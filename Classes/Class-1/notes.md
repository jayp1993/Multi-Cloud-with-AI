## üî∏ **Why Cloud Became Necessary Despite Traditional IT?**

* Traditional IT is **slow, expensive, and hard to scale**.
* Hardware purchase, setup, power, cooling = High Cost.
* Manual provisioning = **More time & effort**.
* High chance of **downtime or failure**.
* Maintenance of physical servers = **Extra manpower**.
* Hard to scale up/down based on need.

üü¢ **Cloud Solves These:**

* Pay-as-you-go model (Cost-effective).
* Auto-scaling & high availability.
* Global access & speed.
* No physical hardware setup.
* Disaster recovery & backup options are built-in.
* DevOps, automation, CI/CD integration is easier.
